# In the following team activity code, after you create a function
# call it so you test that it works.

# *** Add your code after each TODO task ***

# TODO -> Create and call a function called displayName() that displays your
#         name to the screen (ie., use a print() statement in your function).


# TODO -> Create and call a function called displayUserName() that prompts the
#         user for their first and surname and displays it to the
#         screen. 
#
#         Example Output:
#
#         > Enter first name: John
#         > Enter surname: Brown
#         > Hi John Brown


# TODO -> Create and call a function to prompt the user for Fahrenheit and
#         display its Celsius value using a print() statement.
#         (Look up the equation for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius.)
#
#         Example Output:
#
#         > Enter Fahrenheit: -20
#         > -20 Fahrenheit is -28.89 Celsius


# TODO -> Create a function to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.
#         1) Prompt user Fahrenheit value
#         2) Pass that Fahrenheit value to your function and have your
#            function return the Celsius value.  Note: don't place any
#            print() statements in your function.
#         3) Display the Celsius value that was returned by your function.
#
#         Example Output:
#
#         > Enter Fahrenheit: -20
#         > -20 Fahrenheit is -28.89 Celsius


# TODO -> Create and call a function (give it a good name) that prompts the 
#         user for their first name and returns it using the return 
#         statement.  You should not have any print() statements in
#         this function.  In the code that calls your function, 
#         use a print() statement to display the name on the screen.



# TODO -> Create and call a function that prompts the user for their age
#         and returns it using the return statement.  In the
#         code that calls your function, multiply that age by
#         2.34 and display the result.


# TODO -> Create a function called "isFactor(number, factor)" that
#         returns True if the value of "factor" is a factor of "number",
#         return False otherwise.  Write code to call this function and
#         display the results. Try the following values:
#                 isFactor(100, 3)
#                 isFactor(100, 5)
#                 isFactor(100, 9)
#                 isFactor(100, 20)
